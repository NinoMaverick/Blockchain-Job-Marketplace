# Blockchain-Job-Marketplace

A decentralized job marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This platform connects job seekers and employers, allowing them to register, post job listings, and access profiles in a secure and transparent environment.

## Features
- **Job Seekers**: Create profiles with skills, location, and resumes.
- **Employers**: Register company profiles and post job listings.
- **Job Listings**: Employers can post detailed job opportunities.
- **Profile & Job Retrieval**: Fetch job seeker and employer profiles, as well as job details.

## How It Works
1. **Register as a Job Seeker or Employer**: Users can create profiles to participate.
2. **Post or Browse Jobs**: Employers post job listings, while job seekers explore opportunities.
3. **View Profiles and Jobs**: Retrieve profiles or job listings using read-only functions.

## Deployment
